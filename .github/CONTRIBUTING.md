## Naming a branch

Making a branch in your fork for your contribution is helpful in the following ways:

-   It allows you to submit more than one contribution in a single PR.
-   It allows us to identify what your contribution is about from the branch name.

You will want to checkout the `master` branch locally before creating your new branch.

There are two types of branches:

-   Feature
-   Bugfix
-   Docs

**Format**

`Feature/<feature-name>`

`Bugfix/<fix-type>`
